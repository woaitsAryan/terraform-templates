# Terraform Templates

Welcome to the Terraform Templates Repository! This repository is a collection of Terraform templates designed for various use cases, created with the aim of learning and demonstrating Terraform's capabilities.

## Instructions

Each directory in this repository contains a different Terraform template. Each template has its own README file with specific instructions and details about what the template does. Please read these README files to understand the purpose and functionality of each template. Note that these templates are designed according to my personal preferences and use cases.

## How do I run these templates?

1. Ensure you have Terraform installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the [official Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
2. Install AWS CLI on your system by following the instructions on the [official AWS CLI Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and then setting it up using [official AWS CLI Quickstart Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html).
3. Go to the directory of the template you want to run and follow the instructions in the README file.
